JCDM main goal is to collect and synthesize the existing knowledge using novel modelling approaches and provide easy access to modelling results.

# Case study

For each JCDM project activities a tutorial was created, using simulated data, to show how fit the models in a similar way to how they were applied in the publications

## Case study 1 - Presence mapping with heterogenous data
