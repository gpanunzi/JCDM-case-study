# Capitoline Dolphins: Residency Patterns and Abundance Estimate of Tursiops truncatus at the Tiber River Estuary (Mediterranean Sea)


## Tutorial
Here we have created a tutorial, using simulated data, to show how in the paper we improve existing Mark Recapture models:

"Residency Patterns and Abundance Estimate of Tursiops truncatus at the Tiber River Estuary (Mediterranean Sea)" by Pace D.S. et al accepted for publication in Biology (https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10040275)

The model classifies the dolphins according to their site-fidelity patterns and then, with the classification obtained, it makes estimates of abundance.

To obtain results similar to the paper it is necessary to carry out clustering first [clustering](https://github.com/gpanunzi/JCDM-case-study/blob/main/Case%20study%202/ClusterGit.R) and then the abundance estimation [abundance estimation](https://github.com/gpanunzi/JCDM-case-study/blob/main/Case%20study%202/PopanGit.R)

## Observed data
The observed sighthings are also available [here](https://github.com/gpanunzi/JCDM-case-study/blob/main/Case%20study%202/Data/raw_data_turs.txt) together with a text file describing the dataset.
