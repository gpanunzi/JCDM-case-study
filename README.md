# JCDM
Joint Cetacean Database and Mapping (JCDM) is an initiative resulted from a joint effort of the Department of Statistical Science (DSS) and the Department of Environmental Biology (DBA) of the University of Rome “La Sapienza” supported by different institution and entities acting in the field of marine conservation at the Mediterranean level. JCDM main goal is to collect and synthesize the existing knowledge using novel modelling approaches and provide easy access to modelling results.

# Case study

For each JCDM project activities a tutorial was created, using simulated data, to show how fit the models in a similar way to how they were applied in the publications

## Case study 1 - Presence mapping with heterogenous data

Here we have created a tutorial, using simulated data, to show how inlabru can be used to fit a model similar to the one in the paper:

"Integration of presence-only data from several data sources. A case study on dolphins' spatial distribution" by S. Martino; D. Pace et al accepted for publication in Ecography (DOI 10.1111/ecog.05843)

but based on simulated data.
